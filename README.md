# ChromePass

ChromePass was developed using a significant portion of third-party code and adapted to a need to test the detection capability of EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response). After installing the dependencies, simply run the Pass.py file, and it will create a file called "pwd.txt" in the same directory where it was executed, containing all the passwords saved in Google Chrome.
